/**
 * Computes the community edge Gini of the graph, i.e. the Gini coefficient for the
 * number of edges between each pair of communities. This version considers all pairs
 * of nodes in the calculus (i.e. it includes pairings of a community with itself), but
 * autoloops are considered as a whole set of links, instead of separately for each community.
