/**
 * Definition and implementation of reranking algorithms for enhancing global properties of
 * the system.
 *
 * Given a set of recommendations for different users, these rerankers iteratively choose the user-item
 * pair that maximizes a given objective function. A user can only be selected as long as the ranking
 * does not have enough items.
