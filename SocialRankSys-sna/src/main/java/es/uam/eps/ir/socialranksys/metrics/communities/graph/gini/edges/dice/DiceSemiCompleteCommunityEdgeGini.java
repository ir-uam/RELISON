/**
 * Computes the Dice community edge Gini of the graph, i.e. the Gini coefficient over the
 * pairs of communities in the graph, where the frequency is the relation between the real
 * number of edges between communities, and the number of edges between communities in a 
 * configuration network where the link degree distributions are equivalent to the ones in the
 * studied network. This version considers all pairs  * of nodes in the calculus 
 * (i.e. it includes pairings of a community with itself), but autoloops are considered as a 
 * whole set of links, instead of separately for each community.
