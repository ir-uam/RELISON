Data preparation
=================
Before using some of the link prediction / recommendation algorithms and metrics, it is sometimes necessary to prepare some data.
For instance, content-based approaches take as input inverted indexes containing the contents generated by each user in the network,
and supervised methods need a suitable set of feature vectors for each target-candidate user pairs.

In this section, we provide information about how we can generate these data.
