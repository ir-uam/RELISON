Information diffusion
=======================
Online social networks are dynamic environments where using are constantly creating and sharing new information: that is the case of tweets on Twitter, posts on Facebook and Tumblr, etc. The diffusion of these user-generated contents has been object of study for many decades. RELISON provides a diffusion simulator which can be used to perform diffusion experiments.

We provide information about how to perform these simulations in this section.

Everything needed for the simulation of information diffusion is included in the diffusion module of the framework, which can be imported using Maven as:
