Information diffusion metrics summary
==================================================
RELISON provides many tools which can be used to analyze the properties of the information diffusion properties.
We differentiate two types:

* **Metrics**: provide a single value for all the iteration. We summarize the available metrics below:

	.. toctree::
   		:maxdepth: 1

   		metrics/user
   		metrics/infopiece
   		metrics/features

* **Distribution**: analyze individual properties of the different elements in the diffusion (users, contents, user/content features). An individual value for each of these elements is provided each iteration.

	.. toctree::
		:maxdepth: 1

		metrics/distributions
