Edge-based community detection algorithms
============================================
This family of community detection algorithms considers edge properties to compute the partition. We have implemented the following community detection algorithms.

* `Girvan-Newman`_

Girvan-Newman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Girvan-Newman algorithm generates the community partition by gradually removing the edge with the largest betweenness in the network. It generates a dendogram, and the partition that maximizes the modularity of the network is selected.
