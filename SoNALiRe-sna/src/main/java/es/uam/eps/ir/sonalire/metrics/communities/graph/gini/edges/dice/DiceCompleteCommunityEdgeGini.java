/**
 * Computes the Dice community edge Gini of the graph, i.e. the Gini coefficient over the
 * pairs of communities in the graph, where the frequency is the relation between the real
 * number of edges between communities, and the number of edges between communities in a
 * configuration network where the link degree distributions are equivalent to the ones in the
 * studied network. This version considers all pairs of nodes in the calculus
 * (i.e. it includes pairings of a community with itself).
