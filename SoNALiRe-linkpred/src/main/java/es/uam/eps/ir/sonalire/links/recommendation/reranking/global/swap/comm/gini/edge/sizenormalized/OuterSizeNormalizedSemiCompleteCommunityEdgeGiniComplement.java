/**
 * Swap reranker for promoting the balance in the degree distribution for the different
 * communities. Both edges between different communities and links inside of communities are considered,
 * but links between communities are all stored in a single group when computing the Gini
 * coefficient.
 *
 * The number of edges between pairs of communities are normalized by the maximum possible number of edges
 * between each pair of communities.
 *
 * The reranker does not consider improvements of the metric when the candidate user belongs
 * to the same community as the target user.
