# SocialRankSys

A Java library for social network analysis and contact recommendation. 

## Introduction
SocialRanksys is a new Java framework for the implementation and evaluation of techniques for social network analysis and mining. These framework has been created as the result of the research documented in several publications on contact recommendation in social networks (see here) and a [PhD thesis](http://javiersanzcruza.github.io/jsanzcruzado-phdthesis.pdf). But, in addition to those contact recommendation and link prediction functionalities, SocialRankSys can be used to perform multiple social network analysis and network science tasks: analyzing structural properties of social networks (including the most classical metrics, along with several new ones, targeting the structural diversity of the network), community detection and performing information diffusion simulations over social networks. 

The framework has been programmed targetting the Java 14 version, one of the most recent versions of the popular programming language. Built upon the [RankSys library](http://ranksys.github.io), we take advantage of the many features provided by the last versions of Java. The code is licensed under the [MPL 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).
