# RELISON

RELISON is a framework for experimentation on the link recommendation task in social networks, which aims to identify 
those people in the network with whom a user might be interested to connect, interact or befriend.  RELISON provides 
tools for executing and evaluating contact recommendation approaches, considering not only their accuracy, but also aspects 
like their novelty, diversity and the effects that such recommendations have on global properties of the networks 
(as changes in the structural properties or in the characteristics of the information arriving to the users). 
In order to measure these effects, RELISON also provides functionality for a) analyzing the structural properties of social networks,
 b) detecting clusters of users (communities) and c) simulating the diffusion of information in a social network. 
 These functionalities can be used regardless of whether recommendations have been provided to the users.
 
Built upon the [RankSys library](http://ranksys.github.io), this framework has been programmed with Java 14  and has been created as the 
result of the research documented in several publications on contact recommendation in social networks and a 
[PhD thesis](https://javiersanzcruza.github.io/jsanzcruzado-phdthesis.pdf). The code is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License v.2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/).

## Creators
This framework has been created by the [Information Retrieval Group](https://ir.ii.uam.es) at [Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid](https://uam.es). 
The main contributors to this library are:

- Javier Sanz-Cruzado ([javier.sanz-cruzado@uam.es](javier.sanz-cruzado@uam.es))
- Pablo Castells ([pablo.castells@uam.es](pablo.castells@uam.es))

## Packages
Up to date, the following packages have been published:
- **Relison-core:** Basic graph definitions and generators.
- **Relison-sna:** Social network analysis metrics and community detection.
- **Relison-content:** Classes and definitions for user-generated contents in social networks.
- **Relison-linkpred:** Link prediction and contact recommendation functionalities.
- **Relison-diffusion:** Simulation of information diffusion dynamics.
- **Relison-examples:** Examples showcasing the functionality of the library.

## System Requirements
- **Java JDK:** Java 14 or above.
- **Maven:** Tested with version 3.6.0.
- **R:** Tested with version 3.6.3.
- **GLIBC:** In Linux, to execute path-based approaches, this library uses JBLAS 1.2.5, which requires
  GLIBC version.
- **Matlab:** For some matrix-based approaches, we provide alternative implementations in Matlab. It has been tested with version R2020a.

## Instalation
In order to install this framework, you need to have Maven [http://maven.apache.org](http://maven.apache.org) installed 
on your system. Then, download the files into a directory. If you want to obtain a .jar containing all the packages,
go to the Relison-examples directory and execute the following command:
```
mvn compile assembly::single
```

If you just want to install and add all the packages to your Maven library, in the main directory, execute the command:
```
mvn install
```

Once it is installed in your Maven library, you can import the package you are interested to use in your project 
adding the following dependence.
```
    <artifactId>Relison-[package-name]</artifactId>
    <groupId>es.uam.eps.ir</groupId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
```
We plan to add the library to Maven Central in the future, but, as of now, it is not available there. 

In case you do not want to use Maven, it is still possible to compile the code using any Java compiler.
In this case, you will need the following libraries:
